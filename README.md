# SMSNinja
SMSNinja is a lightweight but highly efficient firewall for blocking and hiding SMS, MMS, iMessages, phone calls and FaceTime on stock Phone and Message Apps. It's so powerful that I, as a startup member, no longer have time maintaining it :|

### Pros:
The source code covers most of the SMS, MMS, iMessages, phone calls and FaceTime operations on iOS 5 ~ 8, so if you're doing anything related, SMSNinja will be a very good reference.

### Cons:
The source code is ugly modulized and poorly designed. I hate my inelegance and that's why I refused to open source SMSNinja for a long time :(

### TODO:
1. Redesign SMSNinja according to MVC;
2. Rewrite the UI part with Xcode;
3. Remodulizing SMSNinja;
4. Redesign databases;
5. Maintain an online blacklist;
6. Add iOS 9 support.

You can refer to the book [iOS App Reverse Engineering](https://github.com/iosre/iOSAppReverseEngineering) if you don't know how to develop a tweak.
For any questions, please raise them on [my forum](http://iosre.com).
If anyone can pick up the work and TODOs, thanks for your contribution to a cleaner iOS. Cheers!
